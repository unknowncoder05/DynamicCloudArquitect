# Interactive Story Diagram - Implementation Guide

## Overview

The Interactive Story Diagram feature has been successfully implemented using **ReactFlow**, a powerful React-based library for building node-based editors and interactive diagrams. This implementation provides a visual way to manage characters, events, groups, and their relationships in your story.

## Why ReactFlow?

After evaluating multiple options (D3.js, Cytoscape.js, vis-network, Sigma.js), **ReactFlow** was chosen because:

1. **Native React Integration** - Built specifically for React, no wrappers needed
2. **TypeScript Support** - First-class TypeScript support out of the box
3. **Interactive by Design** - Built for editing, not just viewing
4. **Customizable Nodes** - Easy to create distinct visual styles for different entity types
5. **Production Ready** - Used by many companies in production environments
6. **Built-in Features** - Zoom, pan, drag-and-drop, minimap, controls
7. **Excellent Documentation** - Active community and comprehensive guides

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Core Components Created

#### Custom Node Components
- **CharacterNode** (`src/components/diagram/CharacterNode.tsx`)
  - Displays character photo, name, description, and DOB
  - Purple color scheme
  - Edit and delete buttons

- **EventNode** (`src/components/diagram/EventNode.tsx`)
  - Shows event name, description, effects, and involved entities
  - Green color scheme
  - Calendar icon

- **GroupNode** (`src/components/diagram/GroupNode.tsx`)
  - Displays group name, description, and member count
  - Orange color scheme
  - Group icon

#### Main Diagram Component
- **StoryDiagram** (`src/components/diagram/StoryDiagram.tsx`)
  - Main canvas for the interactive diagram
  - Toolbar with node type selector and add/save buttons
  - Built-in controls (zoom, pan, fit view)
  - MiniMap for navigation
  - Legend panel showing node types
  - Background with dot pattern

#### Pages
- **DiagramPage** (`src/pages/DiagramPage.tsx`)
  - Full-page diagram view
  - Mock data for demonstration
  - Connected to Redux for state management

### 2. Type Definitions

Created comprehensive TypeScript types in `src/types/diagram.ts`:
- `Character` - Character entity with photo, DOB, description
- `Event` - Event entity with effects and involved entities
- `Group` - Group entity with members
- `Relationship` - Connections between entities
- `DiagramNode` - ReactFlow node wrapper for entities
- `DiagramEdge` - ReactFlow edge for relationships

### 3. API Integration

Added complete CRUD endpoints in `src/services/api.ts`:
- Character endpoints (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
- Event endpoints (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
- Group endpoints (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
- Relationship endpoints (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)

### 4. State Management

Created Redux slice (`src/store/diagramSlice.ts`) with async thunks for:
- Fetching all entities and relationships
- Creating new entities
- Updating existing entities
- Deleting entities
- Error handling and loading states

### 5. Routing

Added `/diagram` route to the application:
- Protected route (requires authentication)
- Accessible from dashboard via "Open Diagram" button
- Integrated with existing auth flow

## Features Implemented

### Core Features
- ✅ Visual representation of characters, events, and groups as nodes
- ✅ Dynamic relationships between nodes (edges)
- ✅ Drag-and-drop node positioning
- ✅ Add new nodes (characters, events, groups)
- ✅ Delete nodes with edit/delete buttons
- ✅ Connect nodes to create relationships
- ✅ Animated edges for relationships

### UI/UX Features
- ✅ Zoom and pan controls
- ✅ Minimap for navigation
- ✅ Background grid pattern
- ✅ Node type selector dropdown
- ✅ Color-coded nodes (Purple=Character, Green=Event, Orange=Group)
- ✅ Legend panel
- ✅ Toolbar with actions
- ✅ Responsive design

### Technical Features
- ✅ TypeScript support throughout
- ✅ Redux state management
- ✅ API integration ready
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Build passes with no errors

## Usage

### Accessing the Diagram

1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to the Dashboard
3. Click on "Open Diagram" button
4. The diagram page will open with demo data

### Working with Nodes

**Adding a Node:**
1. Select node type from dropdown (Character, Event, or Group)
2. Click "+ Add Node" button
3. Node appears on canvas at random position
4. Drag to reposition

**Editing a Node:**
- Click the edit icon (✏️) on any node
- (Modal/form to be implemented in future enhancement)

**Deleting a Node:**
- Click the delete icon (🗑️) on any node
- Node and its connections are removed

**Creating Relationships:**
1. Hover over a node to see connection handles
2. Drag from the bottom handle of one node
3. Drop on the top handle of another node
4. Animated edge is created

### Saving Changes

Click the "💾 Save" button in the toolbar to persist changes (currently shows demo alert).

## Next Steps / Future Enhancements

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Edit Modal/Form** - Implement proper editing UI for node data
2. **Backend Integration** - Connect to actual Django API endpoints
3. **Auto-save** - Implement periodic auto-save functionality
4. **Undo/Redo** - Add history management for user actions

### Enhanced Features
1. **Advanced Layouts** - Auto-arrange algorithms (tree, force-directed)
2. **Search/Filter** - Search nodes by name or properties
3. **Export** - Export diagram as image (PNG, SVG)
4. **Templates** - Pre-built diagram templates
5. **Collaboration** - Real-time multi-user editing
6. **Custom Relationships** - Different relationship types with labels
7. **Node Details Panel** - Side panel showing detailed node information
8. **Validation** - Prevent invalid connections
9. **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Productivity shortcuts for common actions
10. **Tutorial/Onboarding** - Interactive guide for first-time users

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Virtualization** - For diagrams with 1000+ nodes
2. **Lazy Loading** - Load nodes on-demand
3. **Memoization** - Optimize re-renders

## Dependencies Added

```json
"reactflow": "^11.11.4"
```

## Build Status

✅ Build passes successfully with no errors
✅ All TypeScript types are correct
✅ ESLint warnings resolved

## Testing the Implementation

### Local Development
